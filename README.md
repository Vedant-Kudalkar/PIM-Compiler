# PIM-Compiler
The PIMCompilerProject is a compiler designed to translate matrix multiplication operations into machine instructions for Processing-In-Memory (PIM) architecture. This project exploits loop parallelism by distributing independent iterations across multiple processing elements (PEs), thereby accelerating matrix computations.
